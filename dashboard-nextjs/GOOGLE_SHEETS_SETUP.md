Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your dashboard with real data from Google Sheets!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Service account not found"**
   - Make sure you shared the sheet with the correct service account email
   - Check that the email in `.env.local` matches exactly

2. **"Invalid private key"**
   - Copy the entire private key including begin/end markers
   - Make sure `\n` characters are preserved
   - Wrap the key in quotes in your `.env.local`

3. **"Sheet not found"**
   - Verify the sheet ID in your URL matches `.env.local`
   - Ensure the sheet is accessible (not deleted)

4. **"Permission denied"**
   - Check that APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
   - Verify service account has proper roles

### Getting Help:

If you're stuck, the dashboard will automatically fall back to mock data, so it will always work. The console will show warnings if there are connection issues.

## üîÑ Data Flow

Once configured:
1. Your dashboard reads data from Google Sheets in real-time
2. Any changes you make to the sheet appear immediately
3. If connection fails, it gracefully falls back to mock data
4. All data is cached for better performance

Your SmilePoint dashboard is now powered by Google Sheets! üöÄ
